# word_embedding
A word embedding is a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning have a similar representation. It is this approach to representing words and documents that may be considered one of the key breakthroughs of deep learning on challenging natural language processing problems.

# Word_embedding Example

Thus by using word embeddings, words that are close in meaning are grouped near to one another in vector space. For example, while representing a word such as frog, the nearest neighbour of a frog would be frogs, toads, Litoria.
